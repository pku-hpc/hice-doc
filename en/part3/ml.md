# ml

> This module mainly support some basic machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithm Supported

* [K-Nearest-Neighbor](ml/knn.md)
* [Support-Vector-Machine](ml/svm.md)

## Add new algorithms

If you want to add new machine learning algorithms, some rules need to be known [here](../part4/new-op.md).

Add the cases to test if the new algorithm run correctly, see [here](../part4/test-op.md)ã€‚
